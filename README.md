# Drowsiness_detection &#128564;
This is my personal project and i have built different cnn models using tensorflow, trained them using a kaggle eye dataset to detect sleep detection.

The pipeline is as follows
<p>&#9658; Start the camera </p>
<p>&#9658;Take the image as model input</p>
<p>&#9658; Detect the faces in the image </p>
<p>&#9658; Detect the eyes in the faces </p>
<p>&#9658; send the eye region to the trained model for drowsiness detection</p>
<p>&#9658; if drowsiness detected &#9658; trigger the alarm for 5 secs</p>
<p>&#9658; if not repeat the process </p>

<p>The project is still in progress as it needs fine tuning to achieve better accuracy &#128580;</p> 
<p>This approach can be used to detect driver drowsiness in cars and alert him to avoid fatal crash</p>

# Road blocks &#129301;
<p>&#9658; need to deal with different lighting conditions </p>
<p>&#9658; need a data set to train model considering different angles </p>

# possible developments &#129488;
<p>&#9658; an app can be developed to use a mobile camera and can be connected to the Speed Limiter Device in the vehicle via bluetooth to slow down a conventional vehicle  </p>
